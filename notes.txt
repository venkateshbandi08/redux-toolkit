1. Create Store
    - creat store using "configureStore" from @reduxjs/toolkit
    - export the store
2. Wrap the entire app with the Provider
    - wrap with "Provider" from @reduxjs/toolkit
    - and give a store value as store={store}
3. Defining Slicers
    - Declare the Initial state on how the data should be managed/stored
    - create a slice using the "CreateSlice" from @reduxjs/toolkit and export it
    - fill the slice object with the :
        - name,
        - initial state,
        - reducers object with the number of actions to be performed as an object
    - we can use "nanoid" from @reduxjs/toolkit which works same as uuid
    - export slicerName.reducer, where this will be used in store
4. Performing actions on the state
    - by using "useDispatch" from react-redux, we can perform the declared list of operations
      that we initialised in the slicer object
5. Accessing / extracting the stored data from store/state
    - by using "useSelector" from react-redux, we can get the data that we have stored in the store/state.
6. Handling async operations :
    - By using createAsyncThunk function, we can write the async functions for fetching etc.
    - extrareducers should be used in the slice to make the state and action operations, it also has a builder
    an inbuilt arg, it takescare of all the promises for an async call.
